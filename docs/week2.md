## Question 3: Rank the six teams in order of which you think is *strongest overall*.
**Methods:** Rankings are determined by an elimination round system not unsimilar to that used by the City of Minneapolis for City Council elections. Bug me about it if you *really* want to know details (or check [vote_counting.ipynb](https://github.com/demarkd/unrivaled-power-poll/blob/main/vote_counting.ipynb) in the source repository, I guess).

###Comments:
Little change from last week except Mist tumbling to the bottom. It appears that our panel has decided their poor performance is not a fluke. Meanwhile, the Lynx-led teams have separated from the pack. Every single voter put Vinyl in third.
