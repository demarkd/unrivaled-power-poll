### Comments:
Our panel *LOVED* the first weekend of unrivaled! The most pessimistic panelist "only" gave it a 7/10, and a solid majority gave it at least 9/10.

## Question 2: Rank the six teams in order of which you think is *strongest overall*.
**Methods:** Ranking determined by an elimination round system not unsimilar to that used by the City of Minneapolis for City Council elections. Bug me about it if you *really* want to know details (or check [vote_counting.ipynb](https://github.com/demarkd/unrivaled-power-poll/blob/main/vote_counting.ipynb) in the source repository, I guess).

###Comments:
First weird quirk of the voting system I chose: though the average ranking for Phantom was lower than that for Rose or Mist, they ended up in fourth. This means that more people had Rose and Mist in higher spots on their ballot, but ultimately, a majority had Phantom over Rose and a majority had Phantom over Mist. (If you're wondering why I chose a voting system that allows such quirks, I will refer you to [Arrow's impossibility theorem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem))

## Question 5: Which game was your favorite of the weekend past?
### Results:
#### 1. Mist ![][3] - ![][2] Owls (10)
#### 2. Laces ![][1] - ![][3] Mist (1)
#### Recieving no votes:
 Rose-Vinyl, Phantom-Laces, Owls-Rose, and Vinyl-Phantom.
### Comments:
Both Mist games included! Apparently, Stewie's pain is our delight >:)


## Question 6: Which game are you looking forward to most this coming weekend?
*Note:* Only ten respondents gave a response to this question.
### Results:
#### 1. Laces ![][1] - ![][6] Vinyl (6)
#### 1. Vinyl ![][6] - ![][2] Owls (4)
### Comments:
Both Vinyl games included! People are excited to see the top teams battle it out, and we don't get a Laces-Owls matchup this week....

## Question 7: Any other thoughts about Unrivaled?
### Results:
#### Respondent #2: 
"Phee and Stewie deserve all the flowers and more for what they've done with this."
#### Respondent #8:
"First weekend of Unrivaled delivered and then some. All of the work that went into educating fans about the new league paid off. My excitement and buy in was only magnified because of the way the 2024 Lynx season ended (Breanna can have the first Unrivaled shot but Phee has the first Unrivaled WIN). I love the organic seeming way that team personalities and traditions are forming (Hootie Hoo, Golden shoe, Vinyls mic, Ghost Gang, etc). I love the pre and post game shows and only wish that Max kept them available after they were originally live streamed (must be a quirk with the TNT agreement)."

## Closing comments:
As we saw in questions 1 and 7, Unrivaled is a whole heap of fun and so far a big success! Thanks to all our panelists for participating in the first weekly power poll!
