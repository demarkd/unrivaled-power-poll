### Comments:
Our panel *LOVED* the first weekend of unrivaled! The most pessimistic panelist "only" gave it a 7/10, and a solid majority gave it at least 9/10.

## Question 2: Rank the six teams in order of which you think is *strongest overall*.
Ranking determined by an elimination round system not unsimilar to that used by the City of Minneapolis for City Council elections. Bug me about it if you *really* want to know details (or check [vote_counting.ipynb](https://github.com/demarkd/unrivaled-power-poll/blob/main/vote_counting.ipynb) in the source repository, I guess).
