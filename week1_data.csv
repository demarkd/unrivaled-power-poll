My excitement and buy in was only magnified because of the way the 2024 Lynx season ended (Breanna can have the first Unrivaled shot but Phee has the first Unrivaled WIN). I love the organic seeming way that team personalities and traditions are forming (Hootie Hoo, Golden shoe, Vinyls mic, Ghost Gang, etc). I love the pre and post game shows and only wish that Max kept them available after they were originally live streamed (must be a quirk with the TNT agreement). "
